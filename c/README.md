# C utilities

Ah... C... Most of my official programming in C came either in college or on the job. A few bits of unrelated code
survived.

1. `gbstrip.c` is a program designed to strip a certain amount of bytes from a Nintendo Gameboy ROM file.  All apologies to the original author for being unable to properly attribute you.
2. I likely wrote `strpbyte.c` to be more flexible than `gbstrip.c`. The latter utility hard coded the output file name and how many bytes to strip. This tool allows you to pass in values for both. Consider this my first "fork" of existing code.
3. `striphtm.c` is a program to strip HTML tags from a file. Why I wrote this... I cannot say any longer. I do recall it worked well enough at the time, but I highly doubt it would do an accurate job on any complex HTML documents.
