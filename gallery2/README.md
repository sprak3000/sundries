# Gallery2

Long ago, I used a PHP project called [Gallery](http://galleryproject.org/) to self-host image galleries along with a
PHP project called [eZ Publish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZ_Publish) as my blog CMS. Both my use of them and the
projects are defunct. Collected here:

1. Three PHP scripts helpfully prefixed with `test` leverage the Gallery code. `test.php` provides a list of all albums in Gallery. Given an album ID, `test2.php` and `test3.php` provided various blocks of code to embed the images on other sites.
2. `ezpublish3-gallery2` contains a plugin for eZ Publish V3 to display a Gallery album on the site. Instructions on installation and use are lost in the mists of time.
